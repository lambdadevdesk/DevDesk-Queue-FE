# DevDesk-Queue-FE

Frontend Repository

## Project Overview
Students at Lambda School need a place where they can escalate their concerns and receive help. This app allows an admin to manage help desk tickets that come in from Lambda School Students. It also allows students to submit a help desk ticket, categorize it and post it to the help channel.

### MVP
A student should have the ability to login
See currently opened help tickets
Create a new ticket: Title, Short Description, Description, Category

A helper should have the ability to login
See currently opened help tickets
Assign ticket to self
Reassign ticket to ticket list
Resolve the ticket

### Stretch
Build an integrated slack-bot that allows students to submit help tickets through slack.
Allow the ability to subscribe to the Queue in slack to be notified if someone opens a ticket.
